<summary>✅ v1.0 MVP (Phases 1-5) - SHIPPED 2026-03-03</summary>

- [x] **Phase 1: Plugin Foundation & Rule Discovery** - OpenCode loads CARL locally and discovers rules with correct precedence.
- [x] **Phase 2: Matching, Injection & Command Parity** - Rules are matched/injected deterministically with command modes preserved.
- [x] **Phase 3: Session Stability & Live Updates** - Opt-in, reload, brackets, and compaction keep rule behavior stable.
- [x] **Phase 4: Setup Flow & Templates** - Users get a smooth install flow with seeded templates and docs access.
- [x] **Phase 5: OpenCode Rules Integration & Distribution** - Optional rules integration and npm distribution are available.

<summary>✅ v1.1 Polish & Complete Integration (Phase 6) - SHIPPED 2026-03-03</summary>

- [x] **Phase 6: Integration & Developer Experience** - Complete opencode.json integration and troubleshooting/diagnostic tools.

### Phase 6: Integration & Developer Experience
**Goal**: Users have complete OpenCode configuration integration and can troubleshoot plugin issues independently
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: INTE-02, DX-01, DX-02, DX-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can add CARL docs to their opencode.json instructions via setup command
  2. User sees clear, actionable error messages when the plugin fails to load
  3. User can enable debug logging to understand CARL's rule matching decisions
  4. User can reference a troubleshooting guide for common issues
**Plans**: 4 plans (complete)

Plans:
- [x] 06-integration-developer-experience/06-01-PLAN.md — opencode.json instructions integration (INTE-02)
- [x] 06-integration-developer-experience/06-02-PLAN.md — Actionable error messages (DX-01)
- [x] 06-integration-developer-experience/06-03-PLAN.md — Debug logging system (DX-02)
- [x] 06-integration-developer-experience/06-04-PLAN.md — Troubleshooting guide (DX-03)
