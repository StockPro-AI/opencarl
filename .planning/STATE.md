## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 6 (Integration & Developer Experience)
Plan: 3 of 4 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-03 — Completed 06-03: Debug logging integration

Progress: [████████████████░░░░] 84% (16/19 plans complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 17
- Average duration: 6 min
- Total execution time: ~1.7 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Plugin Foundation | 2 | 25 min | 12.5 min |
| 2. Matching & Injection | 4 | 16 min | 4 min |
| 3. Session Stability | 2 | 20 min | 10 min |
| 4. Setup Flow | 4 | 16 min | 4 min |
| 5. Rules Integration | 3 | 4 min | 1.3 min |
| 6. Integration & DX | 3 | 16 min | 5.3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 4, 8, 5, 3, 3 min
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.1]: Scope limited to INTE-02 completion and DX improvements
- [v1.1]: Phase numbering continues from 6 (v1.0 ended at 5)

**v1.0 Decisions (archived):**
- [Phase 01]: Global plugin entrypoint imports the loader via absolute path derived at install time
- [Phase 03]: Rule cache checks dirty flag before returning; session overrides in .carl/sessions/
- [Phase 03]: CRITICAL context bracket uses DEPLETED rules with explicit warning
- [Phase 04]: Setup detection uses process-level guard; idempotent seeding skips existing files
- [Phase 04]: Duplicate plugin detection uses session-scoped warning guard
- [Phase 05]: HTML comment markers for reversible AGENTS.md sections
- [Phase 05]: Dual-package strategy (carl-core + @krisgray/opencode-carl-plugin)
- [Phase 06-integration-developer-experience]: Quick Diagnosis Checklist provides rapid problem identification before detailed sections — Most issues can be identified with 5 common checks, saving time
- [Phase 06-integration-developer-experience]: Organized troubleshooting by issue category (Installation, Loading, Matching, Integration) — Logical grouping helps users find relevant solutions quickly
- [Phase 06-03]: Debug logging integrated across loader, matcher, and hooks with CARL_DEBUG env var — Zero-overhead debug mode enables self-service troubleshooting
- [Phase 06-03]: Debug output uses structured JSON with ISO 8601 timestamps — Machine-readable format for log analysis tools
- [Phase 06-01]: Use relative path ./resources/docs/CARL-DOCS.md for opencode.json instructions — Works across project setups and environments

### Pending Todos
