## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Generate documentation
expected: Running `npm run docs` completes without errors and creates docs/index.html
result: pass
note: "1 warning (IntegrationResult not included) but html generated successfully"

### 2. README as landing page
expected: Opening docs/index.html in browser shows README.md content as the documentation homepage
result: pass

### 3. Source links to GitHub
expected: Clicking on source code links in documentation opens github.com/KrisGray/opencarl at the correct file/line
result: pass

### 4. docs/ gitignored
expected: Running `git status` does not show docs/ directory (it's properly ignored)
result: pass

### 5. Categories in sidebar
expected: Documentation sidebar shows 6 categories: Configuration, Loading, Matching, Injection, Signals, Errors
result: issue
reported: "No I see a list of clickable Modules such as command-parity, context-brackets, debug etc"
severity: major

### 6. Proper categorization
expected: No significant number of exports appear in "Other" category - all are properly categorized
result: issue
reported: "No other category present - sidebar shows modules (command-parity, context-brackets, debug) not categories"
severity: major
