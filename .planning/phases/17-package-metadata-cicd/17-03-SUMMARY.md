# Phase 17 Plan 03: Verification Summary

**Verified package naming consistency and documented legacy string sweep**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-13T11:50:48Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-13T11:52:48Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Ran legacy string sweep for @krisgray/opencode-carl-plugin and opencode-carl
- Verified all source files use @krisgray/opencarl
- Documented allowed exceptions in .planning/ directory
- Verified Docker image builds with opencode-opencarl:e2e

## task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **task 1: record legacy string sweep results** - `675cc9a` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** `675cc9a` (feat: record legacy string sweep)

## Files Created/Modified
- `.planning/phases/17-package-metadata-cicd/17-03-VERIFICATION.md` - Legacy sweep and E2E verification results

## Decisions Made
- All remaining references are in .planning/ directory (allowed exceptions)
- E2E tests have pre-existing issue with .carl vs .opencarl directory naming

## Deviations from Plan
None - plan executed as written.

## Issues Encountered
- E2E tests reference legacy `.carl` directory (pre-existing issue from earlier rebranding phases, not introduced by this phase)

## Next Phase Readiness
- Package metadata fully rebranded and verified
